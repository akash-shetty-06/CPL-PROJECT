# Binary Search Comparison: C vs Python
This project presents a comparative analysis of binary search implementations in two programming languages: C and Python. The goal is to evaluate the performance, syntax, and ease of implementation of binary search in both languages.

C Implementation
The C implementation of binary search is provided in the binary_search.c file. The code is well-commented to explain each step of the algorithm.

Compilation
Compile the C code using a C compiler, for example:

bash
Copy code
gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
Execution
Run the compiled binary:

bash
Copy code
./binary_search
Python Implementation
The Python implementation is available in the binary_search.py file. The Python code is designed to be clear and concise while maintaining readability.

Execution
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python binary_search.py
Performance Comparison
The performance_comparison.py script is provided to compare the execution time of both C and Python implementations for varying input sizes. This requires the timeit module, which is a part of the Python standard library.

bash
Copy code
python performance_comparison.py
Usage
Feel free to use, modify, or extend these implementations for your own projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
